# WallStreetBots: A Simple Guide for E*TRADE Users

*A friendly explanation of what this trading system does and how it relates to your E*TRADE experience*

---

## What is WallStreetBots?

Think of WallStreetBots as a **smart assistant** that watches the stock market 24/7 and looks for specific trading opportunities. It's like having a really dedicated friend who never sleeps, constantly scanning thousands of stocks to find the best deals.

## How is this Different from Your E*TRADE Account?

### Your Current E*TRADE Experience:
- You log in to E*TRADE
- You research stocks manually
- You decide when to buy or sell
- You place orders yourself
- You monitor your positions throughout the day

### What WallStreetBots Does:
- **Automatically** scans thousands of stocks every minute
- **Identifies** specific patterns that historically make money
- **Calculates** the exact best entry and exit points
- **Manages risk** automatically to protect your money
- **Works 24/7** so you don't have to watch the market constantly

## What Trading Strategies Does It Use?

### 1. **WSB Dip Bot** üéØ
**What it does:** Finds stocks that have run up significantly, then waits for a small dip to buy call options.

**Real Example:** 
- NVIDIA runs from $800 to $900 in 3 days
- Most people chase it at $900 (bad idea!)
- The bot waits for it to dip back to $870
- Then buys call options expecting it to continue to $920+

**Why this works:** It's like waiting for a sale at your favorite store instead of paying full price.

### 2. **Earnings Protection Strategy** üìà
**What it does:** Uses options to protect against big earnings surprises.

**Real Example:**
- Apple has earnings next week
- The bot calculates the stock might move 5% up or down
- It sets up trades that profit whether Apple goes up OR down by more than expected
- If Apple stays flat, small loss. If it moves big (either direction), big profit.

### 3. **Smart Options Selection** üß†
**What it does:** Picks the best options contracts based on liquidity and pricing.

**Why this matters:** Not all options are created equal. Some are like trying to sell a house in a ghost town - no buyers. The bot only picks options with lots of buyers and sellers.

## Key Terms Explained (In Plain English)

### **Options** 
Think of options like a "reservation" to buy a stock at a specific price. You pay a small fee for the right (but not obligation) to buy 100 shares of Apple at $180 even if it goes to $200. If Apple goes to $210, your reservation is worth $3,000 profit!

### **Call Options**
A bet that a stock will go UP. Like reserving the right to buy Apple at $180 when you think it's going to $200.

### **Put Options**  
A bet that a stock will go DOWN. Like having insurance that lets you sell Apple at $180 even if it drops to $160.

### **Strike Price**
The price your option "reservation" is set at. If you have a $180 strike call, you can buy the stock at $180.

### **Expiration Date**
When your "reservation" expires. Options have deadlines - they don't last forever.

### **Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega)**
These are just measurements of how your option's price changes:
- **Delta**: How much the option price moves when the stock moves $1
- **Theta**: How much you lose each day as expiration approaches  
- **Vega**: How much the price changes when volatility changes
- **Gamma**: How much Delta changes (advanced stuff)

## How Does Risk Management Work?

### **Position Sizing**
Never risks more than 1-2% of total account on any single trade. If you have $100,000, max risk per trade is $1,000-$2,000.

### **Stop Losses**
Automatically exits losing trades before they get too big. Like setting a spending limit on your credit card.

### **Diversification**  
Never puts all money in one type of trade or one stock. Spreads risk across multiple opportunities.

### **Real-Time Monitoring**
Constantly watches every position and can exit immediately if something goes wrong.

## Questions You Might Have

### **"Is this safe?"**
It's safer than random stock picking because of professional risk management, but all trading involves risk. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.

### **"Will this replace my E*TRADE account?"**
No! This is designed to complement your existing investment strategy, not replace it. Keep your long-term investments separate.

### **"How much money do I need?"**
Options trading typically requires $25,000+ for day trading, but you can start smaller with swing trading strategies.

### **"What if the bot makes a mistake?"**
Every trade has built-in risk limits. Maximum loss per trade is predetermined and small relative to account size.
