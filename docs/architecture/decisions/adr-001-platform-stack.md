# ADR-001: Adopt python platform stack
## Status: accepted
## Context: The codebase currently uses the python stack and associated build/test tooling.
## Decision: Keep the existing stack as the default implementation platform.
## Consequences: New features should integrate with existing toolchain and avoid stack fragmentation.
## Alternatives Considered: Replatform to a different stack; rejected due to migration risk.
