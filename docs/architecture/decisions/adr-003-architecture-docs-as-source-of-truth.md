# ADR-003: Architecture docs govern implementation boundaries
## Status: proposed
## Context: Code-only workflows drift without explicit architecture constraints.
## Decision: Feature and component docs are treated as contract inputs for codegen and regression gates.
## Consequences: Extra maintenance overhead with improved architectural integrity.
## Alternatives Considered: Code-only inference; rejected due to frequent design drift.
